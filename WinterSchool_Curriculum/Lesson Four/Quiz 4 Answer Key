### **Short Answer (sample answers)**

- apply() is used to apply a function along a particular axis (rows or columns) of a DataFrame, whereas applymap() applies a function to every element in a DataFrame (element-wise).  

- Renaming ensures consistent column names across datasets, which is critical for accurate merging.  

- Visualizing data helps identify trends, patterns, and potential issues such as outliers or missing values.  

- An outer merge returns all records from both datasets, filling in NaNs where there are no matches.  

- The index is a label-based identifier for rows; resetting it is useful when the index is no longer meaningful or after filtering.
