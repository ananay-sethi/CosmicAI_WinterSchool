- In hypothesis testing, what is the null hypothesis (H0)?  
    a) The hypothesis that the researcher is trying to prove.  
    b) The hypothesis that there is no effect or no difference.  
    c) The hypothesis that states a significant relationship exists.  
    d) The hypothesis that is always accepted.
- What is the significance of a p-value less than a chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05) in hypothesis testing?  
    a) It means the null hypothesis is definitely true.

    b) Type I error  
    c) Standard error  
    d) Measurement error
- What is the purpose of a confidence interval?  
    a) To give a single-point estimate of a population parameter.  
    b) To define a range within which a population parameter is likely to fall, with a certain level of confidence.  
    c) To prove that a hypothesis is absolutely true.  
    d) To measure the correlation between two variables.
