    a) 'r'  
    b) 'a'  
    c) 'w'  
    d) 'x'

    a) 'w'  
    b) 'a'  
    c) 'r'  
    d) 'x'
- Which method is used to read the entire content of a file as a single string?  
    a) readline()  
    b) readlines()  
    c) read()  
    d) readall()
- What is the purpose of the .strip() method when processing text data from files?  
    a) To convert the string to uppercase.  
    b) To remove leading and trailing whitespace characters (like newlines or spaces).  
    c) To split the string into a list of words.  
    d) To count the number of characters in the string.
- What is the benefit of using with open(...) as f: when handling files?  
    a) It automatically converts file content to a specific data type.  
    b) It automatically closes the file, even if errors occur, ensuring resource management.  
    c) It makes file reading significantly faster.  
    d) It prevents any data from being written to the file.
- What does the line.split(',') method do when applied to a string read from a file?  
    a) It joins the string with commas.  
    b) It removes all commas from the string.  
    c) It splits the string into a list of substrings, using the comma as a delimiter.  
    d) It counts the number of commas in the string.
- The CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is commonly used for:  
    a) Storing image data.  
    b) Storing spreadsheet and database data.  
    c) Storing binary executable files.  
    d) Storing encrypted information.
- What type of files are specifically mentioned in Lesson 2 as being suitable for astronomical data, often containing tabular data?  
    a) .txt files  
    b) .csv files  
    c) .FITS files  
    d) .json files
- The Python library astropy.io.fits is specifically designed for working with which file type?  
    a) CSV files  
    b) Text files  
    c) FITS files  
    d) Excel files
- When working with .FITS files using astropy.io.fits, what is a common initial step to open and access data from a FITS file?  
    a) Using Python's built-in open() function.  
    b) Using fits.open().  
    c) Using pd.read_fits().  
    d) Using np.load_fits().
- What is contained within an HDUList object when a .FITS file is opened with astropy.io.fits?  
    a) A single image.  
    b) A list of header/data units (HDUs), each containing an image or table.  
    c) Only the metadata of the file.  
    d) A concatenated string of all file contents.
- How would you access the primary data (often an image) from an opened FITS file object (e.g., hdul)?  
    a) hdul.info()  
    b) hdul\[0\].data  
    c) hdul.read_data()  
    d) hdul.get_image()
- What does the .info() method provide when called on an HDUList object from a FITS file?  
    a) The actual numerical data from the file.  
    b) A summary of the HDUs within the FITS file, including their type, dimensions, and data format.  
    c) The file path of the FITS file.  
    d) The checksum of the file.

### **Short Answer Questions**

- Explain the difference between file.readline() and file.readlines() when reading content from a text file. When would you use each?
- Describe the purpose of using the with open(...) as f: statement for file handling in Python. What advantage does it offer over manually calling f.close()?
- What is a CSV file, and why is it a common format for data exchange? How would you typically read a CSV file line by line in Python, assuming it uses commas as delimiters?
- What are .FITS files primarily used for, and what Python library is specifically designed to work with them?
- Describe the general steps involved in opening a .FITS file using the astropy.io.fits library and accessing its data (e.g., an image or a table).
