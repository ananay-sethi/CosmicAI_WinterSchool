open, read, manipulate, and write data from different file formats commonly used in data analysis—**.txt**, **.csv**, and **.fits** files.\n","\n","We will cover:\n","\n","* Reading files using the `open()` function\n","* Accessing file content with `.read()`, `.readline()`, and `.readlines()`\n","* Looping through lines in a file using `for` loops\n","* Cleaning up text data using `.strip()`\n","* Storing file contents in lists for processing\n","* Writing data to files using `open(..., 'w')` and `.write()`\n","* Appending data to files using `open(..., 'a')`\n","* Understanding file paths and working with file locations\n","* Using `with open(...) as f:` for safe and automatic file handling\n","* Reading and working with **CSV files** using Python’s built-in
