Create a new random integer array with Numpy functions. Use a random seed to guarantee the same array every time. Array must be of size (20, 5).\n","\n","2. Calculate the average value of the second column of the array created in exercise 1. Calculate the sum of all elements in columns 3 and 4. You can use built in ufuncs and indexing.\n","\n","We will now use a simple IoT readings dataset for this exercise. This dataset contains IoT temperature readings, where the reading was made (room) and location (reading was outside or inside a room).\n","\n","3. Open the data file `IOT-temp.csv` inside the `iotdata-compressed` file, you will need some program like 7zip or Winrar to uncompress this `iotdata-compressed` folder.
